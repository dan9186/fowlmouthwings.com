# Fowlmouth Wings Website
This is the source code for [fowlmouthwings.com](http://www.fowlmouthwings.com).

# Developing
You'll need to clone the repo to your local system first, and is only necessary once.  A recommended read is [Understanding Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for what the steps below mean.

1. Checkout a branch for editing on
2. Edit the files as you see fit
3. Commit the changes to your branch
4. Push the branch
5. Create a Pull Request against `master`
6. Merge the PR

Following this workflow will result in your changes being deployed to [new.fowlmouthwings.com](http://new.fowlmouthwings.com) for preview before making it mainstream. You can follow that workflow as many times as necessary without any concern for it messing up the primary website.

# Deploying
Once everything is set on [new.fowlmouthwings.com](http://new.fowlmouthwings.com) the way you want it, you can deploy to [fowlmouthwings.com](http://fowlmouthwings.com) by creating a Pull Request from the `master` branch to the `release` branch. A fast and easy way to do that will be to click the buttons available on the [compare release](https://github.com/dan9186/fowlmouthwings.com/compare/release...master?expand=1) page.
